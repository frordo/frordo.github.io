Some more discussion of [CSES problems](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/)!

1. [Permutations](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1070/): So the logic for this is pretty straightforward. Just group the evens and the odds and it will obviously work, except for some weird edge cases. So we just deal with \\(n=2 \\) and \\(n=3\\) separately. My first submission had a <code style="color: red;">TIME LIMIT EXCEEDED</code>. But I realized it was because I was calling the *print* function \\(n\\) times. 

    So instead I switched to <code>sys.stdout.write(" ".join(map(str, a)))</code> which is something new I learnt. Python is weird.
 
2. [Distinct Numbers](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1621): This is trivialized by built-in data structures in python -- simply do `len(set())`. So I tried not using them and got a <code style="color: red;">TIME LIMIT EXCEEDED</code>. My initial code was something like this:

    ```python
    n = int(input())
    l = input().split()
 
    myset = []
    for i in l:
        if i not in myset:
            myset.append(i)
 
    print(len(myset))
    ```
    Some guessing reveals that this is \\(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\\) (one *n* for the foor loop and another for the `if not in myset` check) which is sub-optimal. Instead the next natural idea is to use a hashmap:

    ```python
    import sys

    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    x = sys.stdin.readline().split()
    d = {}
    c = 0
    for i in x:
        if not d.get(i):
            d[i] = True
            c += 1

    print(c)
    ```

    Forgive my variable names. I had to use `sys.stdin.readline()` since I was *still* getting <code style="color: red;">TIME LIMIT EXCEEDED</code>. Apparently it's faster than `input()`. Otherwise this code is pretty easy. But the result is still slower than the original built-in data structures. Perhaps I will investigate under the hood. [Apparently](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3949310/how-is-set-implemented) it is just a hashmap.
