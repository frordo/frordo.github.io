Some more discussion of [CSES problems](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/)!

1. [Bit Strings](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1617): I think pretty much everybody knows this. The \\(\pmod{10^9 + 7}\\) part is kind of weird though. Not sure why we need that?

2. [Trailing Zeros](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1618): It would've made for a nice problem. Unfortunately I already knew the solution from JEE prep. This is just the p-adic valuation \\((\nu_5(n!))\\). Obviously there are more factors of five. See [Legendre's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula).
