After a lot of effort, got github pages and jekyll to run!

I'm going to learn how to code, and document it for future analysis. Today I finished week 0 and week 1 of CS50x. I already knew most of the subject matter so I was done with the problems pretty fast. I will start week 2 tomorrow! Prof Malan is fantastic. 

{% highlight ruby %}
#import <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}

{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight ruby %}
$ make hello
$ ./hello
Hello, world!

{% endhighlight %}

It took a lot of effort to add MathJax and $\LaTeX$

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
$$\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$$
